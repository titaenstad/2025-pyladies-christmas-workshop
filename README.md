# PyLadies Christmas Workshop

Welcome to the PyLadies Christmas Workshop! In this workshop, we will use Python to create beautiful designs with the Turtle library, and then bring those designs to life with embroidery, craft cutters, and printers. Whether you're an experienced programmer or just starting out, there's something for everyone.

Let's get coding and crafting together!

## Setup

To create patterns, you will need a Python installation with Turtle (which will work for most standard Python installations). However, if you don't have a Python installation on your machine, then you can also use our experimental [TurtleThread web editor](https://marieroald.github.io/2025-pyladies-christmas-workshop), which has both Turtle and TurtleThread installed (**Note:** The web editor is a work in progress and can be a bit slow in Chrome and Edge).

### Cloning the repo and using a package manager (PDM or uv)

First, you need to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarieRoald/2025-pyladies-christmas-workshop
```

Then, you enter the cloned directory and install the dependencies with [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
cd 2025-pyladies-christmas-workshop
pdm install
# OR with uv
# uv sync
```

### Installing TurtleThread manually

You can install TurtleThread with whatever package manager you like (we recommend using a virtual environment). For example, with pip:

```bash
pip install turtlethread
```

or pdm, uv or poetry

```bash
[pdm/uv/poetry] add turtlethread
```

## Converting EPS to PDF and SVG

If you want to cut or draw your Turtle designs with the cricut cutter, then you'll need to convert it into an SVG file, and you want to print it on paper, then you'll need to convert it to a PDF file. You can either use vector drawing programs like [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/) or online tools like [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com) or [ConvertIO](https://convertio.co/).

## Inspiration

### Some turtle patterns:
If you want inspiration for Turtle drawings, you then you can look in the [example_turtle](./example_turtle) directory. For an overview of the available Turtle commands, we recommend checking out the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

### Embroidery
For TurtleThread, you can either look in the [example_turtlethread](./example_turtlethread) directory or check out the [TurtleThread documentation](https://turtlethread.com/) check out the [example gallery](https://turtlethread.com/en/auto_examples/index.html) or the [christmas ornament guide](https://turtlethread.com/en/christmas/index.html).

### Data visualisation ornaments:

We can also make ornaments from data visualisations and there are some examples in the [example_plotting](./example_plotting/) directory that you can look at for inspiration.
